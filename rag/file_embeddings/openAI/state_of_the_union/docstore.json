Six days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.\n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination literally inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees, to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nAnd in this struggle \u2014 President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament, \u201cLight will win over darkness.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight sitting with the First Lady. Let each of us, if you\u2019re able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world and Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nShe\u2019s bright, she\u2019s strong, and she\u2019s resolved.\n\nYes. We, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people.\n\nThroughout our history, we\u2019ve learned this lesson: When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos; they keep moving; and the costs, the threats to the America \u2014 and America, to the world keeps rising.\n\nThat\u2019s why the NATO Alliance was created: to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War Two.\n\nThe United States is a member, along with 29 other nations.

We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world.\n\nJust look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy \u2014 the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis. He and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day.\n\nInsulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That\u2019s what it costs the \u2014 the pharmaceutical company. But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times that amount.\n\nI spoke with Joshua\u2019s mom. Imagine what it\u2019s like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God\u2019s name you\u2019re going to be able to pay for it \u2014 what it does to your family, but what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it. Think about that. That\u2019s what I think about.\n\nYou know, yesterday \u2014 Joshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.\n\nFor Joshua and 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let\u2019s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it. And drug companies will do very, very well \u2014 their profit margin.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it \u2014 I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this \u2014 let\u2019s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans to save them $2,400 a year on their health premiums.

Pfizer is working overtime to get us a million pills this month and more than double that next month.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re launching the \u201cTest to Treat\u201d initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy and, if they prove positive, receive the antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\n\nAnd folks if you\u2019re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\n\nWe\u2019re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone\u2019s needs as we move forward.", "start_char_idx": 26363, "end_char_idx": 28629, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdb3353b-0ec8-4759-b7ca-310db852106b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdb3353b-0ec8-4759-b7ca-310db852106b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../data/state_of_the_union.txt", "file_name": "state_of_the_union.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46071, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f1ff0de-65b0-4a5a-a863-5a9e9245d394", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../data/state_of_the_union.txt", "file_name": "state_of_the_union.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46071, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-13"}, "hash": "d849e54e6095029ac517537315106d5804e8e801b366b056478462a4179a7c50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70bf8964-f97b-4c7b-a6bb-c6ced2ceb64a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../data/state_of_the_union.txt", "file_name": "state_of_the_union.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 46071, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-13"}, "hash": "8b72251b472f25441abb26c6a8c47bfa12537b24023dc1bc2079977b30ffdaed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0929435-67ba-4cd5-81ab-89686c1f0d4b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea1da129431abf2e6917beab42001d1edc17146c4cf7cdb89d3bc45a678ebd7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We\u2019re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone\u2019s needs as we move forward.\n\nOn testing, we\u2019ve made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve already ordered free tests. If you already ordered free tests, tonight I\u2019m announcing you can order another group of tests.

If necessary, we\u2019ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of maybe months or years.
