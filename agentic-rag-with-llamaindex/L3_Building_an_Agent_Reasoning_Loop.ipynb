      "Agents in MetaGPT share information through a publish-subscribe mechanism. This involves storing information in a global message pool where all agents can exchange messages directly. Agents publish their structured messages in the pool and can access messages from other entities transparently. This approach allows any agent to retrieve required information directly from the shared pool, eliminating the need for individual inquiries and waiting for responses, thus enhancing communication efficiency.\n"
