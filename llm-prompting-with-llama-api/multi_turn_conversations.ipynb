      "4. **Wine harvest**: Portugal is famous for its wine production, and the fall season is an excellent time to visit wine regions like the Douro Valley, Alentejo, and Porto. You can participate in wine tastings, vineyard tours, and harvest festivals.\n",
      "5. **Scenic landscapes**: Portugal's fall foliage is stunning, with the changing colors of the leaves creating a picturesque backdrop for your travels. The **Serra da Estrela** mountains, **Ria Formosa** natural park, and **Costa Vicentina** coastal route are just a few examples of the beautiful landscapes you can explore.\n",
