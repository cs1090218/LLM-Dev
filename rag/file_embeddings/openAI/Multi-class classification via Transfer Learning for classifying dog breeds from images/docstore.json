Introduction \n The Dog Breed Identi\ufb01cation 2023 challenge involves classifying images derived from the \n Stanford Dogs Dataset  into a set of 120 dog breeds.  This dataset contains images of 120 \n breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and \n annotations from ImageNet  for the task of \ufb01ne-grained image categorization. The dataset \n comprises 20,580 images with approximately half being available for training and the rest \n hidden for testset. We are required to output 120 probabilities for each image input which \n would serve as the model\u2019s prediction for the image belonging to each of those categories. \n The data spread is not very skewed with the most frequent breed occurring 125 times and \n the least frequent one 65 times in the training data. \n 2.  Image Pre-processing \n First we performed some basic image preprocessing which includes resizing all images to \n 300x300 pixels, normalizing and standardizing the color channels and transforming the \n result to tensor.

This leads us to augment our training data \n transformations with such transformations. In order to not lose the actual training data \n with these transformations, we over-sampled the training set and applied these \n transformations which allowed us to have original as well as transformed images in the \n dataset. Note that only the basic transformations are applied to the validation set and the \n test set. There are some pre-existing set of image transformations like  AutoImageProcessor \n from HuggingFace but we used our own custom one. \n 3.  Model Architecture \n Our model uses the embeddings generated from a couple of pre-trained vision models \n namely ResNet50 [1] and InceptionV3 [2]. These embeddings are concatenated for each \n image into an embedding space of 4096 dimensions (2048 + 2048).
